# Deep Learning for Alzheimer's Stage Classification from MRI Scans

A robust deep learning model designed for the analysis and classification of medical images, specifically for identifying the stages of Alzheimer's disease from brain MRI scans. This project leverages **transfer learning with a ResNet50 architecture** to achieve high accuracy, with a special focus on handling severe class imbalance.

## üìå Project Overview
Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is critical for patient care and treatment planning.  
This project develops an **automated system** for stage classification using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques.  
The model classifies an MRI scan into one of four categories:

- **Non-Demented**  
- **Very Mild Demented**  
- **Mild Demented**  
- **Moderate Demented**

The dataset presents a **severe class imbalance**, with later-stage cases being rare. This project implements techniques to overcome this, ensuring the model is a **reliable diagnostic aid**.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Results
- **High-Accuracy Classification**: Achieved **95.42% validation accuracy** on 6,400 MRI images.  
- **ResNet50 Architecture**: Leveraged transfer learning from **ImageNet** for robust feature extraction.  
- **Advanced Imbalance Handling**: Applied **class weighting**, achieving **1.0 precision** for the rarest class (*Moderate Demented*).  
- **Efficient Model Design**: Custom classification head with Global Average Pooling to reduce overfitting.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Stratified train/val/test split to preserve class ratios.  

2. **Data Augmentation**  
   - Realistic transformations: rotations, shifts, flips.  

3. **Model Architecture**  
   - Pre-trained **ResNet50** as convolutional base.  
   - Final block unfrozen for fine-tuning.  
   - Custom head:  
     - Global Average Pooling  
     - Dense + ReLU  
     - Softmax output layer  

4. **Training**  
   - Optimizer: **Adam**  
   - Loss: **categorical_crossentropy**  
   - Class weights applied to address imbalance.  

5. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - Special focus on minority class performance.
